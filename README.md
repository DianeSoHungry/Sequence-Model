# Sequence-Model
This is my (Qingyun Hu's) submission of Sequence Model assignment from deep.ai/Coursera.

You are welcomed to refer to this submission if you are stucked somewhere. But please note that submitting work that isn't your own may result in permanent failure of this course or deactivation of your Coursera account.


# A Quick Go-Through

## [Building a Recurrent Neural Network - Step by Step](./1_Building_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step/Building_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step_v3.ipynb)
1. Build an RNN using Numpy. 
2. Build an LSTM using Numpy. 

**Your take-away:**
You will get familiar with how RNN/LSTM cell is constructed and passed from one iteration to the next in detail. You will also get better at numpy.matrix manipulation.

## [Dinosaurus_Island_Character_level_language_model_final_v3.ipynb](./2_Dinosaur_Island--Character-level_language_model/Dinosaurus_Island_Character_level_language_model_final_v3.ipynb)
1. Given a list of Dinosaurs' name, train a RNN model to understand how dinosaurs name themselves, then create new names for dinasaurs via the trained RNN model. 

Apart from building an RNN model with Numpy again, you will also take care of the input and output. Say, How to map an character into a one-hot vector, and vice-versa. Ah, you will also need to deal with gradient explosion by clipping the gradient at each time stamp. This is obviously an one-to-one model, beware that at each step the prediction is affected by all previous inputs, and that the input at each step is not the output from last step, instead, you sample an new one-hot-vector(representing a character in this case) according to this output(probability distribution).

## My Certificate
This part if for my future employers only. I'm actually a very humble indivisual.
